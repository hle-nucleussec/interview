# PHP OOP Practical Test â€” Library Management System

Time Limit: 20 mins

## Objective
Design a basic OOP structure for a **Library Management System** in PHP. 

Disclaimer: Just need to write the high-level classes and functions without the function implementation.
You do **not need to implement** the method bodies or write unit tests due to time constraints

--------
## Requirements:
The system will need to manage books and magazine in the library:
- Each book will have title and author.
- Each magazine will have name and publisher.
- Library can add and remove items (book/magazine)
- Library will allow to borrow and return its item

--------
After that, write a code in `run.php` to:
- create the library with 2 books and 2 magazines
- add those books and magazines to the library
- borrow one book and one magazine
- return the borrowed book
